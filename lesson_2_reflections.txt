What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

There is metadata stored in a hidden directory that makes up the directory a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is used to prepare commits. You add all files for a commit (aka logical change) to
the staging area before commit moves the staging area into the repository.
